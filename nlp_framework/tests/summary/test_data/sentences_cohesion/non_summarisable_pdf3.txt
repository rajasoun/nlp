Virtual Port Channel

 The vPC is a port-channeling 
concept that extends link 
aggregation to two separate 
physical switches.

 It allows the creation of resilient 
Layer 2 topologies based on link 
aggregation.

– Eliminates the need for STP in 
the access distribution

 It provides increased bandwidth. 

– All links are actively forwarding

 The vPC maintains an independent 
control plane.

Cisco NPV-Enabled Environment

NPV Edge Switches

 Need to enable switch in NPV mode

 Changing to and from NPV mode is disruptive:

– The switch reboots.

– The configuration is not saved.

 Supports only F, SD, and NP modes

 Supports 16 VSANs

 Local switching is not supported.

– Switching is done at the core,

NPV Core Switches

 Must enable the N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) 
feature

 Supports up to 100 NPV edge switches

NPV-enabled switches are standards-based and 
interoperable with other third-party switches in the 
SAN.
