Task 7: Validate QoS, Configure Adapter, Scrub, and QoS 
Policies 

In this task, you will verify that global QoS allows Ethernet jumbo frames. You will configure 
adapter, scrub, and QoS policies. 

Activity Procedure 
Complete these steps: 

Step 1 In Cisco UCS Manager, choose the Equipment tab and expand Equipment > 
Fabric Interconnects > Fabric Interconnect A. 

Step 2 In the content pane, click the LAN Uplinks Manager link. 

Step 3 Choose the QoS tab. 

Note Because QoS is a global setting that applies to both fabric interconnects, the QoS setting 
was preconfigured for you. The Gold QoS Priority is disabled by default. 

Step 4 Verify that the Gold Priority is enabled, Packet Drop is checked, Weight is none, 
and MTU is 9216. 

 

Step 5 Click OK to close the LAN Uplinks Manager. 

Step 6 In the Servers tab, expand Policies > Root > Adapter Policies. 

Note Observe that there are six default adapter policies that can be applied to a service profile. 
These policies define adapter settings that are generally desirable for Linux, Windows, and 
VMware. If a service profile does not explicitly choose an adapter policy, then the default 
adapter policy is applied to that service profile. Adapter policies for Ethernet and Fibre 
Channel are individually configurable.  

 

Note Because these policies are created at the root level of the organizational hierarchy, they can 
be consumed by service profiles in any suborganization.

Adapter Policy. 

Step 9 Click the enabled radio button for Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and set the Failback 
Timer to 2 seconds. 

Step 10 Click OK to save your new adapter policy. 

Step 11 The QoS setting and adapter policy will be selected in the service profile template 
that you create in Lab 6-2. Any service policies that are created from the template 
will inherit the QoS setting and adapter policy. 

Step 12 While still under the policies of your organization in the navigation window, right-
click Scrub Policies and choose Create Scrub Policy from the pop-up menu. 

Step 13 Name the scrub policy, according to the lab implementation sheet. 

Step 14 Choose the Yes radio button for Disk Scrub.

Task 3: Configure Uplink Ports to Northbound Communications  
In this task, you will configure two port channels to provide a communication path from the 
fabric interconnects to the aggregation and core layers of the data center network. This is often 
referred to as northbound communication. Communication from the fabric interconnects to the 
IOMs is referred to as southbound. 

Activity Procedure 
Complete these steps: 

Step 1 Configuring uplink ports is similar to configuring server ports. Choose either fabric 
interconnect in the Equipment tab of the navigation pane. Click the LAN Uplinks 
Manager link.

Step 2 Instead of creating individual links, create a two-interface port channel on each 
fabric interconnect. Click Create Port Channel to begin the wizard. You are 
presented with the choice of Fabric A or Fabric B. Choose Fabric A to create the 
first port channel on Fabric A. 

 
Step 3 On the first screen of the port channel creation wizard, enter a port channel ID of 1, 

and then click Next. 

 
Step 4 Press Ctrl and choose ports 19 and 20 from the port list. Click >> to add the ports to 

the port channel. Click Finish to end the wizard. Repeat these steps to create a port 
channel with ports 19 and 20 on Fabric B.

Step 5 Your port channels should appear in the LAN Uplinks Manager. Choose each port 
channel and then click Enable to complete the process. 

 
Step 6 Click OK to close the LAN Uplinks Manager.

Task 4: Configure IP Communication to Cisco IMC  
In this task, you will configure a pool of IP addresses that will be assigned to the Cisco IMC on 
each server blade. 

Note To avoid confusion when using the term Cisco IMC, it is important to consider the context in 
which it is used. In the context of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Servers, Cisco IMC 
refers to the configuration user interface. In the context of Cisco UCS B-Series devices, 
Cisco IMC refers to the chip on the server motherboard that provides access to KVM, IPMI, 
and SoL services. In earlier versions of the documentation, the Cisco IMC was called the 
BMC. 

Activity Procedure 
Complete these steps: 

Step 1 Navigate to the Admin tab and choose the Communications Management filter 
from the drop-down list. Choose the Management IP Pool icon. 

 
Step 2 Right-click Management IP Pool and choose Create Block of IP Addresses.

Step 3 Create a block of eight addresses starting at 192.168.10.51 and then click OK. 

 

Activity Verification 
When you complete this activity, your network topology should be like the following:
