Organizational Challenges

―I need to take a long-term view . . . and have short-term 
wins. I want to see more business value out of IT.‖ 

―Our applications are the face of our business.‖
―It is all about keeping the application available.‖

―As long as my servers are up, I am OK.‖

―We have too many underutilized servers.‖

―I need to provide lots of bandwidth and meet SLAs for 
application uptime and responsiveness.‖

―Our information is our business. We need to protect
our data everywhere—in transit and at rest.‖

―I cannot keep up with the amount of data that needs to 
be backed up, replicated, and archived.‖

Virtualization Challenges

Virtual domains are growing fast and becoming 
larger.

Network administrators are involved in virtual 
infrastructure deployments.

 The network access layer must support consolidation and 
mobility.

Higher network (LAN, SAN) attach rates are required. 

 Multicore processor deployment affects virtualization and 
networking requirements.

Virtualization solution infrastructure management

 Management demarcation

Cloud Computing 
Overview



© 2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. DCUCD v4.0—1-15

Cloud Computing Overview

IT resources and services are abstracted from the 
underlying infrastructure.

They are provided in a multitenant environment:

 On-demand provisioning

 Infinite scalability appearance

 Pay-as-you-go billing

 Self-service model

A cloud could be off-premises, hosted model or
application hosting, and so on.

Cloud Computing Service Categories

Software as a Service (SaaS)

 Applications services are delivered over the network. 

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

 Software development frameworks and components are 
delivered over the network. 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

 Compute, network, and storage services are delivered over 
the network.

Public Cloud

IT resources and services of customer premises sold 
with cloud computing qualities:

 Self-service

 Pay-as-you-go billing

 On-demand provisioning 

 Appearance of infinite scalability

 Limited customer control



© 2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. DCUCD v4.0—1-20

Private Cloud

Enterprise IT infrastructure with cloud computing 
qualities:

 Self-service

 Pay-as-you-go chargeback 

 On-demand provisioning 

 Appearance of infinite scalability

You can consolidate, virtualize, and automate data center 
resources with

 Provisioning and cost-metering interfaces to enable self-service IT 
consumption



© 2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. DCUCD v4.0—1-21

Scaling a Private Cloud

Initially 

 One or two noncritical application systems

Later

 Combine IT resources under single cloud operating system 
or management platform

 Provide tens to thousands of applications and services

 Enable new architectures for very large-scale compute 
activities



© 2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. DCUCD v4.0—1-22

Federation

A federation of clouds links disparate cloud 
infrastructures with one another: 

 Connect and aggregate management and billing

 Allow exchange and leverage of resources 

The federation can occur across data center and 
organization boundaries with cloud internetworking.

The federation can provide a unified infrastructure, 
provisioning, and metering and billing.

Virtual Private Cloud

A virtual private cloud is a service offering that allows 
enterprises to extend their private clouds to include 
infrastructure services that are provided by the 
service provider.

 Leverage services of third-party IaaS providers.

 Virtualize trust boundaries through cloud internetworking 
standards and services.

 Access vendor billing and management tools through a 
private cloud management system.



© 2011 Cisco Systems, Inc. All rights reserved. DCUCD v4.0—1-24

Open Cloud

An open cloud is a federation of similar 
infrastructures offered by different service providers.

 Open, on-demand infrastructure services

 Intercloud standards and services

 Standards for consolidated application and service 
management and billing

 Decouple one-to-one business relationships with service 
providers

Cloud Computing Trends

Approximately 50 percent of services spending is 
defined as SaaS. The five segments of enterprise IT 
include business applications, application 
development software, system software, storage, and 
servers.

Summary

 Data centers have to address growing demands despite their 
operational limitations.

 The challenges for data centers include resource utilization, 
organizational management, service availability, solution 
scalability and management, and expense containment.

 Cloud computing provides on-demand resources in a pay-as-
you-grow manner.

 Cisco already has solutions and designs that were created 
with cloud computing in mind, such as Vblock infrastructure 
packages, secure multitenancy, desktop virtualization, and 
cloud-in-a-box.
