IUWNE v1.0—5-*

Cisco WCS Location Tracking
RF “Closest AP”
Pro: Simple with no new technology requirement
Con: Limited accuracy; an AP can easily cover several thousand square feet
RF Triangulation
Pro: More accurate than a single RF RSSI
Con:  Limited accuracy; does not account for effects of building material which may cause reflection, attenuation or multipath
RF Fingerprinting
Pro: GPS-like accuracy 
Con: More comprehensive (requires RF prediction tools)
Cisco WCS uses fingerprinting

Summary
Cisco WCS is management software used to offer a single point of control for the whole wireless network. 
It can also be used to track wireless devices and locate them on a map. 
Several license versions exist, depending on the number of APs and Cisco WCS instances to manage. 
Cisco WCS offers many features, such as central management, planning, or network statistics.
When more than 10,000 APs are to be controlled, Cisco WCS Navigator allows navigation among Cisco WCS instances.
