Walt Disney Animation Studios, headquartered in Burbank, California[6] (formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation, Walt Disney Productions and Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio), is an American animation studio which creates animated feature films, short films, and television specials for The Walt Disney Company. Founded on October 16, 1923,[1] it is a unit of The Walt Disney Studios. The studio has produced 53 feature films,[7] beginning with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), and its most recent being Frozen (2013).
Originally founded as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923 and later incorporated as Walt Disney Productions in 1929, the studio was exclusively dedicated to production of short films until expanding into feature production in 1934. In 1983,Walt Disney Productions named their live-action film studio Walt Disney Pictures and their animation film studio Walt Disney Feature Animation. During a corporate restructuring in 1986, Walt Disney Productions was renamed The Walt Disney Company. In 2006, Walt Disney Feature Animation took on its current name of Walt Disney Animation Studios when it was folded under The Walt Disney Studios alongside Pixar Animation Studios, which was acquired by Disney in the same year.
For much of its existence, the studio was recognized as the premier American animation studio; it developed many of the techniques which became standard practices of traditional animation, such as the multiplane camera.[8] The studio also pioneered the art of storyboarding, which is now a standard technique used in both animated and live-actionfilmmaking.[9] The studio's catalog of animated features are among Disney's most notable assets, and the stars of its animated shorts—Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto—have gone on to become recognizable figures inpopular culture, as well as becoming mascots for The Walt Disney Company as a whole.
Walt Disney Animation Studios, today managed by Pixar heads Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter, continues to produce animated features using both hand-drawn and computer generated imagery techniques. Their 54th feature, Big Hero 6, is currently in post-production and set for release on November 7, 2014.
