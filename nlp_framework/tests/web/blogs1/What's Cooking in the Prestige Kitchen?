even years ago, while cooking in his kitchen, TT Jagannathan, the TTK Group boss, had wondered why people don’t use microwave ovens to cook rice. The answer was immediate and obvious—the process would make the rice dry. He took that thought to his office—a nondescript high-rise on Bangalore’s Brigade Road—and discussed it with the members of his research and development department. For the next five years, a team worked on designing a microwave pressure cooker that would yield the same results as a regular pressure cooker. In late 2011, it launched the product in Japan, which has a huge appetite for both rice and technology. It turned out to be a big hit. (It even got a patent in Japan for the product earlier this year.)



Aggressive marketing had worked. But there was a less obvious reason too: Fukushima. The nuclear disaster that hit the country earlier that year had created huge demand for energy efficient appliances—including microwave pressure cookers.



This was a case of disaster helping business. Jagannathan has experienced the other side of the coin too, when disasters can also be, well, disasters. Consider the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Around that time, TTK Prestige was selling its pressure cookers in the US under a brand name that was Indian, yet familiar to American customers—Manttra. This business, under the direct supervision of Jagannathan, was showing promise. But the tragic events of that day resulted in an economic slowdown that led to several bankruptcies, including that of 16 of the 27 partners that TTK had at the time. The company lost money and, eventually, decided to shut down the US business.



The scenario at home was no better. The unorganised sector was eating into Prestige’s market share. Excise duty and sales tax added up to over 50 percent, making branded products such as Prestige and Hawkins too costly. “And it is neither a rocket nor an iPhone. Anyone could make it, and they did,” Jagannathan says. One way out was to add features that the mass players couldn’t. He decided to launch a smart cooker with advanced aspects. That flopped in the market, not least because one of the parts was defective. The company had to recall those pieces. By 2002, its losses were half of its net worth, its debt was four times its equity, and it was in a segment that had stagnated.



This was especially painful for Jagannathan. Prestige is the flagship company of the TTK Group, founded by TT Krishnamachari in 1926 before he went on to serve as a finance minister in Jawaharlal Nehru’s Cabinet. In the 1970s, when almost every company in the group (which has interests in a variety of segments including pharmaceuticals and health care services) was losing money, Prestige held strong; in fact, its cash reserves had helped fund the turnaround of others.



Cut to 2013 and Prestige has gone beyond pressure cookers. It now makes a range of kitchen appliances—from mixers to microwave ovens to iron boxes. It is a major player in retail too—it will have 500 outlets by the end of this year, and double the number in the next three years. And the picture only gets rosier. Its five-year growth rate is 33 percent against the sector’s growth of 12 percent. Its operating margin, at 13.6 percent, is above the sector average. And the markets have acknowledged the growth: In the last five years, its share price has gone up by 2,300 percent, earning higher slots in the Forbes India Rich List in the last two years. Jagannathan does not feature in the most recent list since the stock, after much yo-yoing, is just five percent over what it was during the same period last year. But that does not diminish the way Jagannathan has turned around TTK Prestige, quietly, without much fanfare. His path involved going back to basics, some unconventional thinking, using insights from the social sector, working with the government, and, above all, an unwavering focus on innovation.



Most media profiles of the 66-year-old Jagannathan focus on his love for cooking, the time he spends in the kitchen and how that helps him in product development (a role he took up in Prestige from day one, partly because of his training as an engineer at IIT, Madras). But Jagannathan is also an inveterate traveller who spends 15 days in a month on the move, mostly visiting dealers, spending the time in shops and talking to customers. He was just back from a trip to Kerala when he spoke to Forbes India, and he had met 79 dealers in those two weeks.
